# Class Utilities

Building `class` attributes in templates means joining strings, toggling classes on conditions, and stopping later utilities from clashing with earlier ones (`p-2` and `p-4` should not both survive). In JavaScript that work is split across [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) and [tailwind-merge](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge). TailwindPHP ships PHP ports of both, so you get the same behavior with no Node.js toolchain and no extra Composer packages.

Three functions cover the spectrum: `cn()` constructs and de-conflicts, `merge()` only de-conflicts, and `join()` only concatenates.

## cn()

The recommended utility. It runs clsx-style conditional construction first, then resolves Tailwind conflicts with tailwind-merge — so the last conflicting utility wins.

```php
use function TailwindPHP\cn;

// Conflicts are resolved — px-4 overrides px-2
cn('px-2 py-1', 'px-4');
// => 'py-1 px-4'

// Conditional classes via a key => bool array
cn('btn', ['btn-primary' => true, 'btn-disabled' => false]);
// => 'btn btn-primary'
```

### Accepted arguments

`cn()` accepts any number of arguments. Each is flattened and filtered with clsx semantics:

| Argument | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `string` | Added as-is. |
| `int` / `float` | Cast to string and added. |
| Sequential array | Each element is processed recursively. |
| `key => bool` array | Each key is added when its value is truthy. |
| `null`, `false`, `0`, `''` | Ignored. |

```php
cn('flex', ['items-center' => true], ['p-4', ['gap-2']], null);
// => 'flex items-center p-4 gap-2'
```

### Component pattern

`cn()` is what makes a component overridable: merge the component's own classes with whatever the caller passes, and conflicts resolve in the caller's favor.

```php
use function TailwindPHP\cn;

function Card(array $props = []): string {
    $class = cn(
        'rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm',
        $props['class'] ?? null
    );
    return "<div class=\"{$class}\">" . ($props['children'] ?? '') . "</div>";
}

Card(['class' => 'p-6', 'children' => 'Content']);
// <div class="rounded-lg border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow-sm p-6">Content</div>
```

For declarative, multi-axis component styles, pair `cn()` with [variants()](/docs/class-utilities/variants).

## merge()

Conflict resolution only — no conditional construction. Pass class strings; later classes override earlier ones when they target the same property. Use it when your input is already plain strings.

```php
use function TailwindPHP\merge;

merge('px-2 py-1 bg-red-500', 'px-4 bg-blue-500');
// => 'py-1 px-4 bg-blue-500'

// Conflict resolution is variant-aware
merge('hover:bg-red-500', 'hover:bg-blue-500');
// => 'hover:bg-blue-500'
```

`cn()` is `merge()` composed on top of clsx, so reach for `merge()` directly only when you do not need the conditional array syntax.

## join()

Simple concatenation with no conflict resolution. Falsy values are dropped, but conflicting utilities are all kept. Use it when you know there are no conflicts and want the cheapest option.

```php
use function TailwindPHP\join;

join('foo', 'bar', null, 'baz');
// => 'foo bar baz'
```

## Which should I use?

| Function | Constructs (conditionals, arrays) | Resolves conflicts | Use when |
|----------|:---:|:---:|----------|
| `cn()`    | yes | yes | Default choice — building class strings that may conflict. |
| `merge()` | no  | yes | Input is plain strings; you only need de-conflicting. |
| `join()`  | yes | no  | You know there are no conflicts and want minimal work. |

## Imports

```php
use function TailwindPHP\cn;
use function TailwindPHP\merge;
use function TailwindPHP\join;
```

All three live in the main `TailwindPHP` namespace and are bundled with the package. They are PHP ports of clsx (by Luke Edwards) and tailwind-merge (by Dany Castillo).
