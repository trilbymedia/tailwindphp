# Advanced

TailwindPHP is a 1:1 port of TailwindCSS 4.x to pure PHP. The guiding principle is fidelity: the codebase mirrors the original TypeScript project file-for-file — same file names, same organization — so that any behavior in TailwindCSS has an obvious home in PHP, and so that upstream changes can be tracked without guesswork.

Anything that is *not* part of the TailwindCSS port lives in one clearly marked place: `src/_tailwindphp/`. That directory holds the PHP-specific helpers — a reimplementation of the Rust `lightningcss` transforms (`LightningCss.php`), the CSS minifier (`CssMinifier.php`), and the companion library ports (`lib/`: clsx, tailwind-merge, CVA) under the `TailwindPHP\Lib\*` namespace. Everything else under `src/` corresponds to a file in TailwindCSS.

Correctness is verified against Tailwind's own test suite. Test cases are extracted directly from TailwindCSS's `.test.ts` files and run against PHP output, so any drift from the original behavior fails immediately. The result is 4,074 passing tests covering utilities, variants, directives, plugins, and the companion libraries.

- **[Architecture](/docs/advanced/architecture)** — the compilation pipeline (parse → scan → compile → optimize → minify), the source layout, the `lightningcss` equivalent, and the `@port-deviation` marker convention.
- **[Caching & minification](/docs/advanced/caching)** — the file-based cache (`cache`, `cacheTtl`, `clearCache()`) and what the CSS minifier does.
- **[Performance & testing](/docs/advanced/performance)** — PHP-specific optimizations, how parity with TailwindCSS is verified, and the code-quality gate.
